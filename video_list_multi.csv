He finally did it. Caddy’s longest individual video. At just over 1 hour long, what could possibly happen? Well, I’ll tell you. Today, Caddy takes a look at a massive load of LEGO games - from Lego Rockband to Lego Island 2, and Lego Racers to Lego Star Wars (SO EXCITED FOR LEGO STAR WARS SKYWALKER SAGA). While we review all of these classics and bad games alike, including a revisit to the original Caddicarus Lego Racers review back in 2012, you’ll be able to see some of the worst games ever in the LEGO franchise - but also some hidden gems like LEGO City Undercover. Included in this video will be LEGO Alpha Team gameplay for the Gameboy Color with a LEGO Alpha Team review Bionicle XBOX gameplay with Bionicle XBOX review, possibly more well-known as Bionicle PS2, LEGO City Undercover PC gameplay with LEGO City Undercover review, originally released by Nintendo as LEGO City Undercover Wii U, LEGO Drome Racers gameplay on Gamecube with a LEGO Drome Racers Gamecube review, LEGO Football Mania gameplay with a LEGO Football Mania review on PS2, also known as LEGO Soccer Mania, LEGO Island 2 PS1 review with LEGO Island PS1 gameplay, LEGO Island Xtreme Stunts gameplay with Island Xtreme Stunts review for the PS2, LEGO Knight’s Kingdom GBA gameplay with a LEGO Knight’s Kingdom review for Gameboy Advance, LEGO Racers 2 gameplay with LEGO Racers 2 review, SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO LOOK AT LEGO RACERS 2 PS2 STUFF. LEGO Racers PS1 gameplay with LEGO Racers PS1 review, LEGO Rock Raiders PS1 gameplay with LEGO Rock Raiders review, LEGO Rockband gameplay with LEGO Rockband review for the random instrument-less Nintendo DS, LEGO Star Wars Complete Saga review with LEGO Star Wars gameplay from the original XBOX and PS2 all the way to the XBOX 360 and eventually PC according to the LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga trailer and LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga gameplay reveal, LEGO Stunt Rally gameplay for Gameboy Color including LEGO Stunt Rally GB review - and maybe even tiny little sumups of games like Lego Racers Gameboy Color, and even the original LEGO Island 1 on PC. No Legoland PC gameplay today, since I already did a review of it. Sorry for stepping on your roost a little bit, Brutalmoose, but I’m sure you’ll understand. Also, special thanks to LEGO themselves for sending me all of brand new sets from Super Mario - the LEGO Mario builds you sent me are beautiful, and incredibly fun to play with. Never thought LEGO sets would end up like this!

Lyrics:
[Chorus: Anderson.Paak]
Rollin' on the 105 (105)
I don't drink when I drive (I don't think you know)
But I gotta do it high (Know)
Blowin' smoke in the sky (Smoke in the sky)
It's something you should try (Something you should try)
Swear to God, it's a vibe (Know)
Got the stainless on my side (Stainless on my side)
This pretty thing by my side (I don't think you know)
Said she rollin' with the vibe (Know)
And she rollin' with the vibe (Rollin' with the vibe)
She rollin' with the vibe (She rollin' with the vibe)
2 a.m., I was all alone (Alone)
Lamborghini truck and a Sade song (Sade song)
All day long just callin' my phone (Phone)
You and your friends wanna tag along
2 a.m., I was all alone (Alone)
Lamborghini truck and a Sade song (Sade song)
All-day long just callin' my phone (Phone)
You and your friends wanna tag along

[Post-Chorus: Anderson.Paak]
You and your friends
You and your (You and your)
You and yours (You and yours)
You and your friends
You and your (You and your)
You and yours (You and yours)
You and your friends

[Verse 1: The Game]
If I'm stuntin' then I'm stuntin', if I'm drippin' then I'm drippin'
Lambo' truck with blue laces, tell Nipsey it's Crippin'
Zero to sixty, still shoot it with precision
These is grown man bars, you niggas sit down while you pissin'
Picture me rollin' like Pac, nigga
But I ain't Pac, nigga
I be in that Bimmer with it cocked, nigga
Death Row chain just for the drip, I'm not affiliated
West Side nigga so they really hate it
I be out in Las Vegas at the MGM
By the crap tables in some MCM
And it's Monday, I'm lookin' like somebody MCM
Niggas better watch they bitches, I be in DM's
Baby Lane killed Pac, niggas killed Baby Lane
Buntry was bustin' back, Heron died in his chains
A fatal car crash killed Fatal Hussein
R.I.P. Kadafi, ridin' down memory lane

[Chorus: Anderson.Paak]
Rollin' on the 105 (105)
I don't drink when I drive (I don't think you know)
But I gotta do it high (Know)
Blowin' smoke in the sky (Smoke in the sky)
It's something you should try (Something you should try)
Swear to God, it's a vibe (Know)
Got the stainless on my side (Stainless on my side)
This pretty thing by my side (I don't think you know)
Said she rollin' with the vibe (Know)
And she rollin' with the vibe (Rollin' with the vibe)
She rollin' with the vibe (She rollin' with the vibe)
2 a.m., I was all alone (Alone)
Lamborghini truck and a Sade song (Sade song)
All day long just callin' my phone (Phone)
You and your friends wanna tag along
2 a.m., I was all alone (Alone)
Lamborghini truck and a Sade song (Sade song)
All-day long just callin' my phone (Phone)

[Verse 2: The Game]
I went from wantin' to be Suge, to hatin' Suge, to fuckin' with him
28 years a long ass time, it's fuckin' with him
Talked to him on the phone the other day
'Bout how he could've signed me before Dre, now I'm back in LA
Ridin' down Sunset with my clip full
Watchin' the sunset 'cause this shit cool
Life be like that, I'm just tryna catch a vibe, nigga
See some bitches, roll some trees and get high, nigga
Run up on my Lambo', that's suicide, nigga
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all time
If the nigga Bron-Bron rap, it'd probably sound like this
Somewhere between Cube and Kiss, I can't miss
Documentary, Doctor's Adv'
When niggas was really goin' platinum on the 'Math
Executive produced by Dr. Dre, but that's the past
But even now, you play with Dre's name, I'm on your ass

Chorus: Anderson.Paak]
Rollin' on the 105 (105)
I don't drink when I drive (I don't think you know)
But I gotta do it high (Know)
Blowin' smoke in the sky (Smoke in the sky)
It's something you should try (Something you should try)
Swear to God, it's a vibe (Know)
Got the stainless on my side (Stainless on my side)
This pretty thing by my side (I don't think you know)
Said she rollin' with the vibe (Know)

She rollin' with the vibe (She rollin' with the vibe)

The Spiffing Brit will be seeing if Skyrim Is A perfectly balanced game with no exploits by becoming Todd Howard and stealing important quest items to gain access to an infinite source of gold. He will also be using Item duplication and Infinite Money Glitches to become a god in Skyrim.

One thing is for certain this game Is Broken!!

So sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Skyrim Special Edition is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if the Becoming God Challenge is broken!! How can you even Become a god in Skyrim without doing a Quest! What strange RPG game exploit is this! Unlimited gold thanks to a gold exploit!

☕ About Cafe Music BGM channel
We are making Cafe music for relaxation, for work, for study, etc.
All music in this video & in this channel is original music by us.
We are playing all the songs.

📜 What is BGMC?
Morning.
Gentle light that shines through the blinds
One glass of water after waking up
The tender breeze from the window that we feel with all our body

These things are too ordinary in everyday life to be conscious.
But we can't live even if one of them is missing.
""BGMC - BGM channel"" has been providing music, hoping to be like them.

Though it is colorless and transparent, we want to make the listener's daily life as colorful as possible.
That is the essence of the music we deliver.

Light, water, wind, and BGMC
A new value for music.

☕ About Cafe Music BGM channel
We are making Cafe music for relaxation, for work, for study, etc.
All music in this video & in this channel is original music by us.
We are playing all the songs.

📜 What is BGMC?
Morning.
Gentle light that shines through the blinds
One glass of water after waking up
The tender breeze from the window that we feel with all our body

These things are too ordinary in everyday life to be conscious.
But we can't live even if one of them is missing.
""BGMC - BGM channel"" has been providing music, hoping to be like them.

Though it is colorless and transparent, we want to make the listener's daily life as colorful as possible.
That is the essence of the music we deliver.

Light, water, wind, and BGMC
A new value for music.

Marshmello - Alone (Official Music Video)
",3:20,1801047833,ALZHF5UqnU4,"[""commentCount': '855005'}""]",17402549,610489,"NEW Mello™️ by Marshmello gear SHOP NOW ▶ https://mellogang.com/collections/new-arrivals/

Download Alone here ▶ http://smarturl.it/melloAlone 

A lot of people ask me where Alone and its lyrics comes from. Truth is, I had just moved away from my friends and family and I started to feel very home sick and lonely like I didn’t belong in my new settings. Everything was just happening so fast and I couldn’t really grasp where I was or who I was but all i knew was that I felt Alone. With the music video, we really wanted to send a message. Nobody knows how you feel, whether you’re homesick, away from friends and family, or if you simply aren’t like everyone else…its ok. The whole purpose of the Marshmello project and the Mellogang is to bring together people from every corner of the world and create a family…a family that we can all count on to never let us feel Alone. I hope you guys enjoy this video as much as I do. It gives me the feels for sure.

I am a composer from Norway and I started this channel with a simple vision: to create a place that you can visit whenever you want to sit down and relax. I compose music that can be labeled as for example: sleep music, calm music, yoga music, study music, peaceful music, beautiful music and relaxing music. I love to compose music and I put a lot of work into it. 

Thank you very much for listening and for leaving feedback. All your warm support really inspires me to work even harder on my music. If you enjoy my work, I would be very happy if you decided to subscribe and join our community. Have a wonderful day or evening!

📜 Message from the composer and creator of Soothing Relaxation:
""I am a composer from Norway and I started this channel with a simple vision: to create a place that you can visit whenever you want to sit down and relax. I compose music that can be labeled as for example: sleep music, calm music, yoga music, study music, peaceful music, beautiful music and relaxing music. I love to compose music and I put a lot of work into it. 

Thank you very much for listening and for leaving feedback. Every single day I am completely astonished by all your warm support and it really inspires me to work even harder on my music. If you enjoy my work, I would be very happy if you decided to subscribe and join our community. Have a wonderful day or evening!""

Lyrics:

I like him 
Like him too 
He my man 
He my boo 
He my type
He so cute 
I want him
Want him too
(x2)

Hop in the whip hop in the truck 
I do whatever i want 
I’m not a hoe i’m not a slut 
I like to fuck and i sure like to suck 
I am that bold 
Freezy like ice 
I'm not a wife so 
Talk to me nice 
You ain’t my type 
I don’t like you 
You a broke boy 
Look at your shoes 
I'm the player 
I am the pimp 
All them boys 
Make em the trick 
All them boys 
They on my shit 
But all them boys make me sick

I do not see you taming me 
Less then there entertaining me 
They just tryna pa play with me
Play with me you pay the fee 

I like him 
Like him too 
He my man 
He my boo 
He my type
He so cute 
I want him
Want him too
(x2)

Dibble in this, dibble in that
Get all the head like i am a brat 
Play with his balls when he up to bat 
Make daddy real proud like i'm Kayla Pratt 
I'm taking a shower, he making the bed
When i leave the city, i leave him on read 
Go get the next, like i get the bread 
He coming with questions, i call him the feds 
He let me plead the fifth, 
Cause he know this box a gift
Eating breakfast noyt @ tiffs 
When i curve him he get stiff 

I go beast mode 
Ball like free throw
Game like cheat code 
Pounds like kilo 

I do not see you taming me 
Less then entertaining me 
They just tryna plpllay with me
You play with me you pay the fee 

I like him 
Like him too 
He my man 
He my boo 
He my type
He so cute 
I want him
Want him too
(x2)

Our Music for relaxation, for work, for study, etc.

📜 What is BGMC?
Morning.
Gentle light that shines through the blinds
One glass of water after waking up
The tender breeze from the window that we feel with all our body

These things are too ordinary in everyday life to be conscious.
But we can't live even if one of them is missing.
""BGMC - BGM channel"" has been providing music, hoping to be like them.

Though it is colorless and transparent, we want to make the listener's daily life as colorful as possible.
That is the essence of the music we deliver.

Light, water, wind, and BGMC
A new value for music.

‘거부’, ‘혼란’, ‘인정’, ‘당당함’의 감정을 겪으며 현실과의 부딪침을 통해 나 자신을 믿어야 한다는 것을 깨닫게 된다. 나는 나를 믿는다(I trust). 나 자신을 믿는다는 것만으로도 나는 당당해질 수 있다.
'나는 나를 믿는다'라는 주제로 시작된 타이틀곡 ‘Oh my god’은 곡의 전개마다 변화되는 과감한 리듬 체인지가 돋보이는 Urban Hiphop 장르의 곡이다. 빈티지한 피아노 소리와 808베이스가 이끌어가는 몽환적인 분위기 그리고 강렬한 사운드가 인상적이며, 오직 (여자)아이들만이 표현할 수 있는 곡이다.

Going through “denial,” “confusion,” “acceptance,” and “confidence” and colliding with reality makes you realize that you have to believe in yourself. I trust myself (I trust). I can be confident just by believing in myself.
The title track “Oh my god” started from having a theme of “self-trust.” It is an Urban Hiphop track in which the stark differences in rhythm that correspond to the atmospheric changes within the song stand out. The fantasy-like mood and the bold sound led by a vintage piano sound and an 808bass are impressive. This track is something only (G)I-DLE can perform.

Billie Eilish: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert
",10:02,1696658,4sZ2_aGsLKU,"[""commentCount': '6505'}""]",128310,2733,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Aug. 26, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- It didn't take long for Billie Eilish to become one of the biggest pop stars in the world, sweep the Grammy Awards' major categories and release the latest James Bond theme. And today, at just 18, she and her brother, Finneas, have accomplished what no one has been able to do for five and a half months: perform a Tiny Desk concert in what certainly appears to be the NPR Music offices.

Of course, due to safety concerns, even the NPR Music staff can't set foot in the building that houses Bob Boilen's desk. But if you look over Eilish's shoulder, there's no mistaking the signs that she's appearing at the Tiny Desk in its present-day form: On the last day before staff began working from home, I took home the Green Bay Packers helmet that sat on the top shelf — the one Harry Styles had signed a few weeks earlier — for safe keeping. In this performance, that spot is empty.

So how the heck did they do it?

Honestly, it's best that you watch the whole video to experience the extent of the technical feat — which, in the spirit of Eilish's Saturday Night Live performance, they're willing to share with you. And thankfully, we still have our ways of photographing the desk, even if the room has fallen silent.

So settle in for a welcome jolt of Tiny Desk innovation, not to mention two of the excellent standalone singles Billie Eilish has released in the past year: ""my future"" and ""everything i wanted."" And, seriously, be sure to watch until the very end.

SET LIST
""my future""
""everything i wanted""

MUSICIANS

LYRICS

They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
shiny till it wasn’t
Feels good till it doesn’t

It was her first real lover
His too till he had another
Oh god when she found out
Trust levels went way down

Of course she was sad
But now she’s glad she dodged a bullet

Took a few years
to soak up the tears
But look at her now
Watch her go

Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now
Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now

Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment

Like that night
Wasn’t wrong, wasn’t right
What a thing to be human
Made her more of woman

Of course she was sad
But now she’s glad she dodged a bullet

Took a few years
to soak up the tears
But look at her now
Watch her go

Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now
Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now

She knows she’ll find love
only if she wants it
She knows she’ll find love
Uhh
She knows she’ll find love
Only if she wants it
She knows she’ll find love
On the up from the way down
Look at her now

Watch her go
Mmm mmm
Look at her now
Ohhhhh
She knows she’ll find love
Only if she wants it
She knows she’ll find love
Look at her now yeah
She knows she’ll find love
(She knows she will)
Only if she wants it
She knows she’ll find love
Wow

Look at her now.

Official ‘cardigan’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Aaron Dessner

Vintage tee, brand new phone High heels on cobblestones
When you are young they assume you know nothing Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you Dancing in your Levi’s
Drunk under a streetlight I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt Baby kiss it better
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone’s bed You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and Giving me your weekends I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line Once in twenty lifetimes
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone’s bed You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars But now I’m bleeding

Cause I knew you Stepping on the last train
 
Marked me like a bloodstain I knew you
Tried to change the ending Peter losing Wendy
I knew you
Leaving like a father Running like water
When you are young they assume you know nothing But I knew you’d linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you’d haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I’d curse you for the longest time Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you’d miss me once the thrill expired And you’d be standing in my front porch light And I knew you’d come back to me
You’d come back to me And you’d come back to me And you’d come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someone’s bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

Lyrics:

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now
Baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down
Baby
We took a trip now we on your block and it’s like a ghost town
Baby 
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doing all this and all that
Tired of beefing of bums you can’t even pay me enough me to react 

Been waking up in the crib and sometimes I don’t even know where I’m at
Please don’t play that niggas songs in this party I can’t even listen to that
Anytime that I run into somebody it must be a victory lap eh 
Shawty come sit on my lap eh
They saying Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store this isn’t a close able gap
I’ve seen some niggas attack
And don’t end up making it back

I know that they at the crib going crazy down bad what they had didn’t last Damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now
baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down
Baby
We took a trip now we on your block and it’s like a ghost town
Baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doing all this and all that 

I’m in the trenches relax
Can you not play that lil boy in the club cause we do not listen to rats
We in the line I buy her a wig she tellin me Tay is the best
Point at that nigga who act like a killer
But you only want from the neck
I’m like the baby I’m not just a rapper you play with me you gon get stressed
Ooooh
Bring Drake to the hood
Surround Drake around Drakes
Even though I got a case
Imma do what it takes

And I never been embraced
And the moneys hard to make
So I bet they on they face right

I know that they at the crib going crazy down bad what they had didn’t last Damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now
baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down
Baby
We took a trip now we on your block and it’s like a ghost town
Baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doing all this and all that 

When he tell the story that’s not how it went
Know they be lying 100 percent 
Move out the Ritz forgot bout the Bent
Valet just called to tell me come get it
I knocked that boy off  I don’t want no credit
If it Was me they wouldn’t regret it
left me for dead and now they want dead it
heart is still beating
My niggas still eating
The backyard it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with Me she spilling the tea and then shawty came back and said she didn’t mean it
Its hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib going crazy down bad what they had didn’t last Damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now
baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down
Baby
We took a trip now we on your block and it’s like a ghost town
Baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doing all this and all that

A delta wave is a high amplitude brain wave with a frequency of oscillation between 0–4 hertz. Delta waves, like other brain waves, are recorded with an electroencephalogram (EEG) and are usually associated with the deep stage 3 of NREM sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS), and aid in characterizing the depth of sleep.

Lyrics:

Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room
He won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth
He's a cowboy kid

Yeah he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet, in the box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah he'scoming for you

[Chorus x2:]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

Daddy works a long day
He be cominghome late, and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice

I've waited for a long time
Yeah the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
Then say, ""Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits, yeah?""

[Chorus x2:]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

Run, run, run, run, ru-ru-ru-run, run, run
Ru-ru-ru-run, run, run, run
Ru-ru-ru-run, run, run, run, run, run

[Chorus x4:]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

LYRICS

I can hear the thunder
Coming from your mouth
And I know my number's up
Give me some Stevie Wonder
Quick put it on before we go under

I can see the lightning
Coming from your ears yeah I see you're frightened
I can see the lion
Sleeps tonight in the tears you're crying

Oohh
Can't love me unless you love you too
Treat yourself like nothing but a fool
Can't love me unless you love you too
Love you too

Come now set the past on fire
Stand up raise your face to the sky my love
Together we can take it higher
Together we can take it higher
Come now set the past on fire
Stand up raise your face to the sky my love
Together we can take it higher
Together we can take it higher

I can see the rainbow
Coming from your heart and it's all ok so
Come now see you're my angel
Say bye to the past, hello to tomorrow

I want love
I want to give it
I want love
Please deliver it
I want love
I want to give it
I want love
Please deliver it
I want love
I want to give it
I want love
Please deliver it
I want love
I want to give it
I want love
Please deliver it

Come now set the past on fire
Stand up raise your face to the sky my love
Together we can take it higher
Together we can take it higher
Come now set the past on fire
Stand up raise your face to the sky my love
Together we can take it higher
Together we can take it higher

We can take it higher

432 Hz Music ! Manifest Miracles ! Positive Energy Awakening ! Meditation Music, Healing Sleep Music
",,26720,TzwxLcNS8kU,"[""commentCount': '0'}""]",559,15,"Everything has an optimal vibration range, frequency, and velocity is called resonance. 432 Hz music stimulates positive energy and awakens the creative life forces that every being carries within itself. These frequencies harmonize the energy structures of cells and the connections between them. 432 Hz music harmonizes human relationships and their connection to natural planetary flows. Music with a frequency of 432 creates resonance in your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual range.

Pythagoras believed that certain rhythms and melodies contributed to good health, purifying the body and mind, stimulating positive energy.

By obeying the natural law of vibration, there was a sacred number of 432, the basic number of natural cycles.

The resonances in your body release emotional blockages and allow spiritual healing. 432 Hz enables the advancement of wisdom and the use of intelligence. By listening to this frequency you are working on unity with the Universe. You become more compassionate, resonating with love and inner peace. As you listen to this magical tune, close your eyes and try to get rid of negative thoughts and feelings. Let the light of positive energy fill you. When you raise vibrations, you also help to amplify the collective good vibrations of the beautiful planet Earth.

432 Hz music broadens your heart and makes you compassionate and loving. A person who resonates with love has an inner peace — and this is the starting point for a world where you live in unity, peace, and harmony, with each other and with Mother Earth.

A powerful healing frequency of 432 Hz helps to establish a meditative state, spiritual healing, stimulates the heart chakra and brings harmony to the body. Research has also shown that listening to 432 Hz music can help stimulate calm and happiness.

Vibrations at 432 Hz are natural vibrations, babies sleep best with them. It doesn't matter what music you listen to if it's at this frequency. Please read more on this frequency fromn our website here https://www.SupernaturalBP.com/why-432-hz-tuned-music/

Aug. 6, 2018 | Bobby Carter -- There was a shift in Mac Miller's boisterous demeanor as he started the third of his three-song Tiny Desk set. It's the first time he's performed tracks from his new album, Swimming, in front of an audience. On ""2009,"" he rubbed his chin with clinched eyes, looking like a young man who's beginning to crack the code. Backed by a piano loop and a string quartet, he reflected on his journey's peaks and valleys thus far.

I ain't asking why no more
I know I'll take it if it's mine
I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

With nearly a decade under his belt at 26 years old, these words ring like an artist twice his age.

We were introduced to Mac Miller via 2011's XXL Freshman Class, which featured a special crop of MCs such as Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill and YG, all of whom are now considered in the upper echelon of hip-hop. After his big splash, he's been able to find a groove and consistently release quality rap records, ultimately keeping his name in the conversation with the other young greats. His 2011 album, Blue Slide Park, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the first independently distributed debut album to do so since 1995's Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound. These consecutive triumphs amassed plenty of fame, fortune and insurmountable obstacles, causing a stumble here and there. Throughout the years, however, Mac has brushed himself off and put it in the music.

For this performance, Mac Miller invited frequent collaborator Thundercat, who graced the Tiny Desk last year and will join Mac on tour this fall. Thundercat put on a dazzling shaker routine and played the deep centerpiece bass line on ""What's The Use?"" These Swimming iterations don't veer far away from the recorded versions, but here, his lyrics seem easier to interpret under live instrumentation.

""What's the Use? (Feat. Thundercat)""

The Best Street Food we found, was definitely the cemita sandwich from Puebla, which was made by the most amazing woman, the Sandwich Ninja of Mexico! The cemita sandwich was cut so fast with amazing skills, EXTREMELY fast! Her knife skills were incredible, chopping and cutting so fast with the avocado fruit and the chicken as well. The way her hands worked was amazing to watch, and this was just one of the street foods we had in Puebla, Mexico! The Chicken sandwich was so plump and delicious

We started our street food tour in Mexico in Mexico city, eating a ton of delicious street food in Part 1 and 2 here:

https://youtu.be/dHnqNOvDi44
https://youtu.be/W0Anp0wmXek

After this, we spent a day on a street food adventure to go to Puebla, all in search of the famous Mole poblano, but we found so much more.  The first thing we did was visit a local market and try out a bunch of food in the market, like juicy lamb tacos, covered in spicy salsa and then spicy stomach tortilla tacos as well. This is the beauty of Mexican street food, the amazing variation and extreme deliciousness of the cuisine that makes your mouth come alive. 


After this, we found the world famous Mexican Mole Poblano, famous from Puebla that was incredibly flavourful, full of chocolate, chilies, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and more!

After exploring the street food market a little more, we drove to Puebla and found the most amazing sandwich ninja cutting up with super human skill each ingredient and fruit like avocado to put into the sandwich and slice with incredible speed and precision! She was so fast! The sandwich was prepared very fast and it was so delicious as well! She had GOD LEVEL skill, her knife skills were so fast and so fun to watch. 

After eating the sandwich with the locals and enjoying the flavour, we went on to have one final meal in Puebla, Mexico, except this one wasn't a street food. We wanted to try the stuffed chili pepper, but it wasn't in season! So we had a pumpkin seed sauce over top of pork and it was still fairly delicious.

Here are the addresses for the locations in this street food vlog:

1) Lamb Tacos with delicious spicy salsa - Inside the Cholula Farmers Market near the town square
2) Amazing Mexican salad bar featuring spicy pickled chipotle chilies and cow feet salad along with Nopales prickly pear cactus salad - Also inside the Cholula farmers market
3) Mole Poblano rich and dark chocolate sauce with chili, nuts, fruit, and cinnamon - Also found inside the cholula local farmers street food market
4) Super human fast cutting skills sandwich lady of Mexico - Found in Puebla downtown - Super Cemitas El As De Oros
5) Pretty delicious but not amazing Pueblan dinner found downtown Puebla

CHIANG MAI, THAILAND - For breakfast we decided to eat at an extreme street food meat stall known as Laab Yong (ลาบยอง). Get ready for raw meat, blood, and bitter bile for breakfast - and some serious meat sweats! #streetfood #ChiangMai #Thailand

Here are the main dishes we ordered:

Raw beef laab (ลาบเนื้อดิบ)
Beef laab (ลาบเนื้อ)
Saa “sadung” (ซ่าสะดุ้ง)
Grilled pork (หมูย่าง)
Sour soup (ต้มแซ่บ)
Soured grilled pork (จิ้นส้ม)
Pork salad (ซ่าหมู)

Total price - 270 THB ($8.66) for everything

What immediately stands out about Laab Yong (ลาบยอง) is how friendly and hospitable the owners and chefs are, they are so bubbly and talkative. They immediately got started with our order - chatting, laughing, and cooking for us all at the same time.

The food was outstanding, great balance of flavor, spice, and bitter bile. All the dishes are good, but nothing compares to the raw beef laab (ลาบเนื้อดิบ), one of the ultimate of all northern Thai street food dishes!

Nothing like early morning Thai street food and meat sweats!

Thank you for watching, hope you’re having a fantastic day!

Here, it was full of basmati rice and huge chunks of beef and huge beef bones with unbelievably delicious bone marrow!

First, we found a local Pakistan street food served right on the street, the fruit chaat! It was a delicious fruit salad topped with a rose syrup! This was amazing, but what was even more delicious than this famous food in Pakistan is the Pizza naan we found next!

After tasting  the fruit chaat, we walked down a local alley in Peshawar that was full of delicious Pakistani street food, like mutton kerahi (sometimes called Karhai) and fried street fish!

We found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the Pizza naan! It was loaded with tomato, coriander, potato mash, and sliced potato! It was quite salty and was delicious!

After this, we made our way to Namak Mandi in Peshawar to visit the super famous and ultra unique Nisar Charsi Tikka! But first, we found a home cooked Pakistani street food, the Saag! Here, it was served with lassi and also Pakistani corn bread! It was so unique!

And for our final meal, we went to the WORLD FAMOUS Nisar Charsi Tikka! Here, we met the LEGEND himself, Mr. Nisar Charsi! Here, you can get huge BBQ kababs and also delicious Mutton Kerahi! It was  so amazing to taste!!!

The street food in Delhi was so mouthwatering and delicious. The restaurant food was also very nice and to die for! I had some amazing curries and Mughlai cuisine at Karim's in Old Delhi.

Here are the specific locations for the Indian street food and Indian restaurants in Delhi that I tried:

1) Paratha at Paratha Wali Gali
2) Pani Puri at Paratha Wali Gali  
3) Kachori  at Paratha Wali Gali  
4) Daulat Ki Chaat at Paratha Wali gali 
5）Stuffed Naan at Kake Di Hattij, Chandni Chowk

6) Beef/Buffalo Kebabs opposite Jama Masjid
7) Chai Tea in the street food street opposite Jama Masji
8) Feast at Karims

Eating at ORIGINAL THAI FOOD TRUCK!  🚚  Asian STREET FOOD on Wheels!
",19:30,977663,g3dtPLivauU,"[""commentCount': '2129'}""]",24185,638,"🎥 Chiang Mai Street Food Tour: https://youtu.be/2hV2MQpTdCg
👍 100% Durian Chips - Order Here: http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z

CHIANG MAI, THAILAND - Ok, so it’s probably not the original food truck of the world, there must be others who’ve sold food out of their truck for about as long as automobiles have been invented. But this red Datsun in the heart of Chiang Mai, is the original Thai street food truck in Thailand! While the food is quite normal Thai street food, it’s the legend, the history, and the coolness factor of the food truck that make it so memorable. #ChiangMai #Thailand #streetfood #ThaiFood

We arrived in middle of the afternoon, and already they were mostly sold out, but they did have enough ingredients for a few more dishes - and even though they said they didn’t have any rice, they managed to come up with a plate for me. That was nice of them.

At first they were a little shy and not so sure why we showed up to eat. But they really warmed up, and were so friendly to us, and eventually started laughing and joking, and they especially loved Micah.

Here are the dishes we ordered, everything very typical Thai street food dishes:

Pad see ew (ผัดซีอิ๊ว)
Chicken holy basil (ผัดกะเพราไก่)
Stir fried vegetables (ผัดผักรวม)

Total price - 140 THB ($4.47)

Again, the food was average - it’s not going to be the best Thai food you ever eat - but the location, the original Thai street food truck - is what made it special. This is just everyday Thai food, enjoyed by everyone.

Location: Right across the street from Wat Chai Mongkhon Temple (https://goo.gl/maps/Fenq3viHq6TDnq6YA)

We tasted a few amazing dishes, bright and early!

First up, for breakfast, we found a lady selling this incredible milk cheese, kind of like curdled milk, right on the street. You can eat it plain or you can order it fried for breakfast with a lot of sugar. We ended up trying both. 

Then, we walked down the street and had a nice and hearty and healthy lunch soup, and rice as well. Super tasty and delicious!

Then we went for a walk and found some street ""huajuan"" rolls stuffed with fermented tofu, very strong and pungent!

All of this was found during the weekly farmers market on the street in Shaxi every friday! If you come to Yunnan in Southern China, come to Shaxi on a friday to visit one of the most amazing street markets! You have to come check it out!

After that, we went for a lunch and tasted classic bai cuisine, including local Matsutake mushrooms and amazing salted pork, which kind of tasted like pastrami! So delicious!!

Street Food in Pakistan - ULTIMATE 16-HOUR PAKISTANI FOOD Tour in Lahore, Pakistan!

Also, just published a full Pakistan travel guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4

I’m very excited to share this first full street food in Pakistan video with you! We started our trip in Lahore, a vibrant, colorful, and packed full of food city. Our first day in Lahore turned out to be a 16 hour street food marathon in Lahore, and it was an amazing day!

Get more details on my Pakistan Travel Guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4

Sadiq Halwa Puri (https://goo.gl/maps/Yoy9dJ6steF2) - We began the day with a very common breakfast throughout Pakistan, halwa puri, but along with chana curry (chickpea curry). We ate off the car, enjoying every bit of the freshly fried puris and curry.
Total price - 640 PKR ($4.78)

Chacha Feeka Lassi (https://goo.gl/maps/RGQBRQaNj8p) - Next we drove over to Gawalmandi, one of the most legendary areas in Lahore for food. We headed straight to a breakfast staple, the lassi shop and had the most creamy heavy milkshake I’ve ever had, called a pera lassi.

Roasted chickpeas - 25 PKR ($0.19) - After exiting an alley, right in front of us was a man selling chickpeas and corn roasted in black Himalayan salt. It’s a very common street food snack in Pakistan.

Sweet potato - 80 PKR ($0.60) - Sweet potato is also a very common street food snack in Lahore, seasoned with masala and a type of citrus juice.

Baba Kulfi Wala - Next we headed over to Shah Alami Market, another huge and bustling market in Lahore.

Kulfi - 20 PKR ($0.15) each - One of the most famous places to eat ice cream in Lahore is Baba Kulfi Wala, and you’ll find a crowd of people standing around the corner of the road eating sticks of their famous kulfi.

Orange juice - 50 PKR ($0.37)

Chana chaat - 120 PKR ($0.89) per plate - One of my personal favorite Pakistani street food snacks of the day was chana chaat, a chickpea snack. He added in all sorts of spices, chutneys, and seasonings, to create a deliciously refreshing snack.

Butt Karahi Tikka Restaurant - Easily one of the most well known restaurants in Lahore is Butt Karahi, specializing in curry made in a rounded pan, called a karahi (we will be eating a lot of karahi’s in Pakistan!). We ordered both a mutton karahi and chicken karahi. Both were amazing, filled with spices and butter, but the tenderness of the mutton was the winner.
Total price - 5,600 PKR ($41.84)

Siddique Fish Corner - You’ll notice that Lahore seems to come alive at night, and street food is everywhere at night. We began the evening with Siddique Fish Corner, one of the best fried fish stalls in Lahore. It was awesome, and so busy.
Total price - 400 PKR ($2.99)

Khalifa Balochi Sajji - Another Pakistani dish I wanted to try was chicken sajji, a type of hand rotisserie chicken. The atmosphere and cooking method was incredible.
Total price - 390 PKR ($2.91)

Khan Baba Restaurant - Finally for our last dinner on this 16 hour day of food in Pakistan, we went to one of Ali’s favorite restaurants in Lahore, Khan Baba. The goat chops were impressive as was the korma curry.

Again, massive thank you to Ali, from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan, taking us around, and organizing everything.

KINGSTON, JAMAICA - I’ve wanted to visit Jamaica for a long time, from the famous jerk and curries, to the unique mix of culture, and reggae music - I was thrilled to finally have a chance to go. And 10 days in Jamaica didn’t let me know - the food, amazing people, and adventure we had on this island were unforgettable. Stay tuned for a full Jamaican food and travel video series throughout this gorgeous Caribbean island.

We begin this trip with a Jamaican street food tour in Kingston, the largest city in Jamaica, and a great place to explore and get a feel of city life, and a mix of cultures represented in Jamaica.

Coronation Market - As one of the biggest outdoor food markets in Jamaica and the Caribbean, you can be assured, Coronation Market is a bustling, colorful, paradise of fruits and vegetables. You’ll find everything you need here to make Jamaican food - from Scotch bonnet chilies to ackee. It’s fantastic. On the way out of the market, we found a man selling soup - Jamaican bean soup with cow skin, and pumpkin soup with chicken feet. It was spectacular. Soup - 120 JMD ($0.88) per bowl

National Heroes Circle - Alice Stall - Next up on this Jamaican street food tour, we headed to National Heroes Circle, known for its street food stalls that sell spicy crabs, soups, and corn. The crab was delicious, simmered with thyme and scotch bonnet chilies. The corn was served with chunks of mature coconut, an amazing combination. And finally Alice, makes some amazing pumpkin soup, full of chicken feet and organs - don’t miss it in Kingston. Crab and everything - 2,600 JMD for everyone - there were about 8 of us.

Ibo Spice Portal - This was an unplanned spot on this food tour - we found it and decided to go check it out. Turned out to be an amazing experience. So Ital food, comes from the world Vital, which is typically a Rastafari way to eat - typically vegetarian, focusing on natural and local ingredients. Ibo Spice Portal is a small Rasta community yard where they always have food cooking and juices brewing. It’s friendly, relaxed, artistic, and the food is delicious. We all enjoyed the mix of vegetarian food, served in a calabash. Also, the guava soursop juice was one of the best I’ve ever had. Ital vegan food - 700 JMD ($5.12) per bowl

Jerk Pan Chicken - Red Hills Road - Finally to finish this Jamaican street food tour of Kingston, we had to eat jerk pan chicken, a staple street food of Jamaica, and something so tasty, you can’t resist. Red Hills Road is the famous pan chicken spot in Kingston and vendors line the road with the barrel grills. The chicken is grilled, slathered in sauce, and topped with bread. Pan chicken - 500 JMD ($3.66) per pack

Thank you for watching this Jamaican street food tour of Kingston. Lots more Jamaican food coming! #Jamaica #JamaicanFood #streetood #Kingston

CHANDIGARH FOOD Tour I Rara MUTTON + Chole BHATURE + Mix CHAAT + SIZZLER + CHAAP + GAJRELA

In January this year we travelled to the city of Chandigarh to explore the street food scene out there. Deemed as India’s first planned city, modelled by the renowned architect Le Corbusier, Chandigarh manifests itself a unique blend of urbane architecture and natural beauty. Let's see what flavours we discovered over here along with our gracious host Dr Avika Khawas from the organization Walk Around India. 
We started the tour of the city's most happening destination i.e Sector 17 or Sector Satra as it is locally called. Our first destination was the iconic Indian Coffee House where we tried their classic veg cutlet, a classic fare that most of the regular visitors prefer when they drop in casually. Due to an affordable menu and an old world charm, this place draws a huge eclectic crowd. 
The second destination Ghazal restaurant was again a renowned family dining place that has been around for a long time. The name refers to a popular genre of Indian music. So here you can enjoy your food listening to the soothing melodies of ghazal. We tried their mix sizzler which is one of their best selling dishes. Both taste wise and proportion wise it was great. 
Our third destination was Gopal's  in Sector 15, market. This place is known for the popular North Indian sweets and snacks. We tried their classic choley bhature and atta panjiri. The former dish was quite delicious and hearty. 
While strolling down this busy general market place in search of more flavour we got attracted to a popcorn seller and that was our four destination. What caught our attention was the specially designed enclosed container inside which the treats were being freshly roasted. It was light and hearty. 
Our fifth stop was a humble shakarkandi cart where a genial aunty was serving a quick chaat made of the same. The boiled and roasted shakarkandi topped with two basic chutneys and rock salt was fun. 
After a short drive we reached our sixth destination Garg Chaat in Sector 23. The mixed chaat that we had ordered was served in a leaf bowl. The balanced use of different ingredients made it quite delicious. We were fascinated by the kala chana in it which was an unusual addition. 
Next we had some fennel and cardamom flavoured tea at our seventh destination called Khokha which was a small yet popular stall in sector 9.
After the tea break we drove to the celebrated Pal Dhaba, our eighth food stop . As recommended by the genial and warm owner Pritpal ji, we tried their mutton rara. It was a rich, buttery and flavoursome mutton curry that had assorted mutton pieces and keema. This place is much celebrated for their non vegetarian fares. 
From there we arrived at our ninth destination named Pic n Move in Sector 8 market complex. Here we decided to have some chicken shorba soup to further the digestion so that we can adjust a couple of more places before calling it a day.
Next we reached Panchkula where our tenth food stop was Naidu South Indian Food Centre. Avika told us that it is one of the best places in the area to have South Indian fare.The vada sambar that we tried was quite decent and value for money. 
The eleventh destination over here was Ice Cream Dot Com, a place popular for desserts and soya chaap. We had ordered their malai soya chaap and it was brilliant. 
The twelfth and final destination of the day was Chilli Chaats. It is a famous place for classic North Indian snacks and sweets. We tried their aloo tikki, paneer pakoda, jalebi and gajrela. Everything was yummy but it was the crisp and moist paneer pakoda that won our heart. Here we met one of our subscribers and all the heartwarming exchanges simply enhanced the eating experience. 
It was indeed a day of gluttony but we were elated to experience the hospitable atmosphere and the outstanding flavours. We are extremely thankful to Avika khawas for her guidance.

China has so many amazing street foods to try, and I've been filming and documenting them for you for the past 4 years. In my opinion, the best noodle dish in China is dan dan noodles, right here in Chengdu, Sichuan. China has some of the best street food around the world, and these dan dan noodles were INSANELY GOOD, some of the best noodles in China for sure!

If you're traveling to China to eat and try different street foods, and perhaps want to learn a little bit about Chinese food and chinese cooking in the process, you need to try a few different variations of Dan Dan noodles. When they prepare the traditional Chinese dan dan noodle recipe right on the street, you can watch as they scoop the main ingredients like chili oil, soy sauce, sichuan peppercorn, and garlic right into the noodle bowl and then place the steaming hot noodles right over top. It's truly satisfying! After they put the noodles over top, they place their signature fried ground pork on top, known in Chinese as shaozi. 

When your dan dan noodles arrive to your table, it is very important to mix up all the chili oil and all of the ingredients throughout. This ensures that the flavour and the hot oil gets coated onto each noodle before you take a bite. It's also quite satisfying mixing the noodles and watching the dark red oil slowly turn each noodle from white into red and silky smooth. 

When you take your first bite, you'll understand why this is one of the BEST Chinese street foods you need to try. The spicy noodles are coated with an incredibly aromatic chili oil and really send you straight up to heaven! It's one of the best forms of Chinese cooking!

Deep Dish Cheese Pizza
RECIPE COURTESY OF GIADA DE LAURENTIIS
Level: Easy
Total: 2 hr 35 min (includes resting time)
Active: 35 min
Yield: 4 to 6 servings

Ingredients

1 teaspoon active dry yeast
3/4 cup warm water 
1 teaspoon honey 
2 tablespoons cornmeal, such as Arrowhead Mills, plus more for dusting
1 teaspoon kosher salt 
2 to 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 
1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for the bowl
6 ounces sliced provolone
1 cup jarred marinara sauce 
1/2 cup grated Parmesan
Dried oregano and red pepper flakes, optional 

Directions

Special equipment: a 9-inch springform pan

Combine the yeast, water and honey in a small bowl. Set aside until foamy, about 5 minutes.

Combine the cornmeal, salt and 2 cups flour in a bowl. Add the water mixture and 1/4 cup olive oil. 
Using your hands, stir together to form a rough dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead the dough, adding more flour as needed, until it forms a slightly tacky but smooth dough that doesn't stick to your hands or the counter, 5 to 10 minutes. Place the dough in an olive oil-coated bowl, turning to coat the dough in the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Position an oven rack in the top third of the oven and another in the bottom third. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Grease a 9-inch springform pan with the remaining tablespoon olive oil. Wrap the bottom of the pan in aluminum foil and set aside.

Gently place the dough in the pan and spread it out to the edges using your fingers. Work the dough about 2 inches up the side of the pan. Shingle the provolone on the bottom of the crust and part of the way up the sides. Spoon the marinara over the cheese and smooth with the back of a spoon. Bake for 30 minutes on the lower rack. Rotate the pizza and move it to the top rack and continue to bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the sauce is slightly darker, another 10 to 15 minutes. 
Sprinkle with the Parmesan and seasonings, if using, and allow the pizza to rest for 10 minutes before unmolding, slicing and serving.

Bangladesh is a true street food heaven. We didn't know when we flew in, but there is a LOT of delicious street food to eat in Bangladesh. In Old Dhaka, AKA Puran Dhaka, you can  spend a lifetime trying new street foods around every corner. And what I loved so much from eating street food around Old Dhaka was not only the delicious mustardy flavour of the street food here, but the friendliness of the Bangladeshi people. 

Everywhere we went to eat street food in Bangladesh, the peoople welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. It left a huge impression on us and left us inspired to come back to eat more street food in Bangladesh again. 

The Bengali food you will taste when you travel in Bangladesh is incredibly delicious. After tasting my first bharta in Old Dhaka, I was convinced that this is some of the best street food around the world. There truly is no other flavour like the food in Bangladesh! You have to come here to try it yourself!

To start out our HUGE Bangladesh Street Food Tour, we visited Puran dhaka AKA Old dhaka bright and early to eat some famous Dhakan Bhakor Khani, also known as the Dhakan biscuit. It's a wheat dough and semolina flour biscuit that has 2 versions, one sweet and one plain. The sweet version has dough and semolina soaked in molasses and saffron. The dough is pushed DEEP inside the tandoor oven, the same ovens used to cook famous Bangladeshi recipes all over the country. It goes PERFECTLY with some delicious Bangladeshi street chai! There are many Bakorkhani stalls in Puran Daka (Old Dhaka), but we visited the most famous one, Nashu Faruker Shera Bakorkhani.

After that amazing Bangladeshi street food biscuit, we went for the ULTIMATE meal of Bangladeshi cuisine, the bhorta feast! We're taking you to Nirob Hotel for some AMAZING Bhortas! When you first come to Bangladesh, everyone tells you to eat the Bhortas, and you may not be sure what they are. Bhortas are a special Bengali cuisine usually made of mashed fish or mashed vegetables with mustard oil, chili, garlic, onion, and the occasional sprinkle of lime. The bhortas are all brought to your table and you pay for what you eat, and leave what you don't touch. I ate a SPICY duck curry that was out of this world! 

After the amazing Bengali curry heaven, we made our way to the most FAMOUS street food in Old Dhaka, the haji biryani. Highly seasoned rice is cooked in mustard oil and filled with extremely tender goat meat and topped with lime! SUPER TASTY!

After this, we're bringing you to a solid street dessert in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, the lassi and faluda, found at beauty lassi, one of the tastiest lassis in the whole country! I personally loved the faluda and found it to be one of my favourite desserts I've ever had!

After the lassi, we're taking you to try a famous Bangladeshi street food, the Pitha rice flour pancake loaded with spicy mustard bhorta. You can find these all over the streets of Old Dhaka and you should definitely try one!

After this, we're finishing off the night by going for the famous Murgh pulao found at nanna biryani. The best part of this dish was the sweet and rich onion gravy that covered the super tender chicken and pulao rice!

If you're thinking of traveling to Bangladesh to eat street food in Bangladesh, DO IT! The food is amazing, the people are friendly, and you will have a great time! I know we will be back for sure!

Street Food in Brazil - Rio de Janeiro! #Brazil #RioDeJaneiro #BrazilianFood #streetfood

Ever since I first learned about the city of Rio de Janeiro when I was a kid growing up, I have wanted to visit. Finally, the time has come. In this Brazilian street food tour in Rio de Janeiro, we’ll go to eat some of the best street food snacks and dishes, some hole in the wall style Brazilian food restaurants, and also visit some of the most unbelievable and gorgeous sights and attractions in Rio de Janeiro. It’s one of the most beautiful cities I’ve ever visited.

Here’s the Brazilian food and things we did:

Mineiro, Sausage Sandwich - 5 BRL ($1.26) - For Brazilian breakfast we headed to Mineiro for his neighborhood grilled sausage sandwich, topped with his house made aioli dressing, cheese, and lettuce, and his own home-made chili sauce. He’s not only an amazing guy, but his sausage sandwich is outstanding. When you’re in Rio de Janeiro, you don’t want to miss it. Located just outside Siqueira Campos MRT Metro station (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA), sets up in the morning about 7 am.

Trem do Corcovado - 65 BRL ($16.44) - Christ the Redeemer - I pre-bought tickets online for the tram, so when we arrived we just picked up and printed the tickets. The tram took about 20 minutes and Christ The Redeemer at the top was breathtaking.

Selaron Steps - Another attraction in Rio de Janeiro that I wasn’t going to miss was the Selaron Steps, created by Chilean artist Selaron. They are so cool and so iconic.

Lunch at Bar Rex - For some seriously meaty Brazilian food, Bar Rex is the spot. They serve an major selection of drinks, but they also specialize in food like roasted chicken, sausages, and the oxtail. The food was outstanding, and the owners are just so cool. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/ZeshTp5D3ggLoGx87

Ipanema Beach - World famous, one of the most well known beaches in the world, and for a good reason - the scenery is spectacular. We had a tea with Marcelo (5 BRL ($1.26) and then tried some of the Brazilian local favorite comfort Biscoito Globo cassava snacks. Finally, another iconic Brazilian drink is the caipirinha (15 BRL ($3.79) made on the beach.

Copacabana Beach - Next up on this Brazilian street food and attractions tour we stopped at the famous Copacabana Beach and had a coconut (6.50 BRL ($1.64) and continued on the Red Beach in Urca to get a good view of Sugarloaf Mountain (Pão de Açúcar).

Bar Urca - Also in Urca, you’ll find Bar Urca, an old food and bar establishment that’s famous for serving empada de camarão (6.50 BRL ($1.64), shrimp filled pastries. Many people order and then sit on the edge of the water in the evening. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/RZAmnMsKWMtvuebFA

Bar Gato de Botas - A Brazilian boteco is a bar and restaurant that serves small plates of food similar to tapas. The owner of Bar Gato de Botas is a legend and his plates of Brazilian food are delicious. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/efeUxoamaHa77vNR6

Brazilian meat kebabs - Finally to end this incredible street food tour of Rio de Janeiro, we returned back to the same spot where we had breakfast, but in the evening, a different yet equally friendly man sets up selling Brazilian meat kebas and home cooked Brazilian food. When you order a kebab, you can get it stopped with cassava powder and drenched in hot sauce - it was so good. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA Sets up in the evening about 6 pm.

Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful city and this Brazilian street food tour and attraction in Rio was amazing - the food, the people, the scenery.

Street Food in Malaysia is the BEST in The World!! And today, we're going DEEP for 3 AMAZING Malaysian Street Foods in Penang, Malaysia! And, we're finishing up with a worth it noodle challenge, to see if this $500 street noodle is really worth the price!

Make sure to follow along behind the scenes:

Penang, Malaysia has some of the best street food in the whole world. And today, our friend Mark is bringing us for a FULL ON Street Food tour of Penang, Malaysia! Get ready to eat some of the best food in the world!

Malaysian cuisine consists of a mixture of Malay, Chinese, and Indian cuisine. What I love so much about Malaysian food is the way all these cuisines blend together and the flavours compliment each other so well.

In Penang, you can have so many different street foods on each corner. In this street food video, we're visiting some very unique and unseen street foods in Penang.

First up, Mark is bringing us to the #1 oldest and most famous Nasi Kandar shop in Penang. Nasi Kandar is a must eat in Malaysia and consists of rice and what feels like hundreds of curries all mixed together. And here in Penang, the birthplace of Nasi Kandar, we are going to the original restaurant, opened in 1907 to try it out! At Hameediya you can find lobster curry, lamb shank, tons of MASSIVe seafood and curry to mix in with your rice, and all served up super SPEEDY NINJA style!!
► Found at: Hameediyah Restaurant
164, Lebuh Campbell, George Town, 10100 George Town, Pulau Pinang

And next up, Mark is bringing us to a classic Malay style Laksa full of so many spices in a big HOT TUB!!! We drove deep into the Kampung ""village"" outside of Penang to find this classic Laksa hot tub full  of flavour! It is such a famous Malaysian food you need to try!
►Found at: Laksa Janggus
 338 MK, Jalan Bharu, Kampung Perlis, 11000, Penang

And to finish up the night, Mark is bringing us for a $500 EXPENSIVE noodle surprise!! Is it worth it? We will see! It was full of secret ingredients you will find out by watching the whole video, I really hope you enjoy it!
And it was found at his favourite Char Kuay Teow shop in Penang, made with tons of WOK HEI smoky goodness!
► Found at: Tiger Char Kuay Teow, Penang, Malaysia
